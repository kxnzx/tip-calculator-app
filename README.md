### What I learned

It took me some time to finish this challenge. The calculator works, however the form does not function the way I want it to. Here are some of the issues:

- The error message "Can't be zero" is displayed by default.
- After the reset button has been clicked the value "0" stays set in place after typing in a new value.

My Questions:

- How can I make the error message and the red focus on the input visible only after the tip percentage button or custom input have been filled in?
- How do I make the value "0" dissapear when a new value is typed in after the reset button has been clicked?

Feel free to leave a comment. Much Appreciated!
